# OS Lab Assignment 2 Report

## System Startup, Process Creation, and Termination Simulation

### Files Created:
1. `subtask1_logging.py` - Logging configuration
2. `subtask2_process.py` - Process task function
3. `subtask3_creation.py` - Process creation and startup
4. `subtask4_termination.py` - Process termination
5. `main_system.py` - Complete system simulation
6. `process_log.txt` - Generated log file

### Implementation:
- Used multiprocessing module for parallel processes
- Implemented logging with timestamps and process names
- Created multiple processes with different durations
- Proper process termination with join()
- System startup and shutdown simulation

### Log Format:
Timestamp - ProcessName - Message
